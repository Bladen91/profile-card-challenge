This is my attempt at the profile card challenge on Frontend Mentor.

After having a go at this challenge I really enjoyed it. Took me longer than I care to admit but still enjoyable.

The profile card does change wisth when moving to a mobile screen.

Only bit I am not so happy with is the bubbles in the background. I dont feel they are as responsive as the design.
